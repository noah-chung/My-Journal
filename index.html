     Peeing in The Wilderness- 09/14/20
    </h2>
    <p>
  There were so many tracks to go on Today, and in excuse I limped to make my Mommy and Daddy go back to the car. It had been more than two hours and I started to feel like going for a number three for the day, so I went to a tall tree, pulled down my pants and started peeing, I looked to the bottom right and saw a tiny red salamander staring at me, I was shocked, so I tried peeing on it using all my force, but sadly before I could hit it with my pee, it got away.

        Squishy Emu poo- 12/23/19
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was finally winter break and Me and my family(including Chewie) went to Wilsons Prompt! On the second last day of staying at Wilsons Propmt, we walked and tries to spot for kangaroos and Emu's. As we walked we saw a small Emu pooping a diarrhea, we watched carefully as the slimy, liquidy diarrhea drooped down the Emu's butt. After finished watching it poo, we walked further into the trail, but I forgot that the Emu had just pooped a diarrhea and I accidently stepped on it! It felt really squishy and it also smelled really bad too. Also not only was it squishy but it was also really deep to, when I stepped on it my whole shoe sank down in the massive poop!

    quarantine dancing- 07/02/19
      </h2>
      <p>
        It was 2019 and in Melbourne we could not go out, we were really bored, so we decided to download Just Dance from the Nintendo switch. We did Just Dance for so long we mastered all of the songs and knew all the dance moves. One time I danced to a song and got first place in the competition! Even today I still play just Dance because it is so fun and addictive! Also one day I turned down all the lights and played Just Dance, it was a cool experience but I ended up hurting myself.
